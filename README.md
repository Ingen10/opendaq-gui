Some demo GUI interfaces for openDAQ, implemented in Python.

These demos require Python 2.7.

**OpenDAQ** is an open source data acquisition instrument, which provides user

digital inputs and outputs, timers and counters.

Through a USB connection, openDAQ brings all the information that it captures
