Installation
============

Just run: 

`$ python setup.py install`

In any case, if for any reason the setup fails, EasyDAQ and DAQControl demos will require the following packages:

- opendaq (can be found in our root repository)

- setuptools

- wxPython

- numpy

- matplotlib 

- dateutil

- pyparsing

In Windows, you will need to include the route "C:\Python27\Scripts" into the system "Path" variable, if it does not already exist (System->Advanced Settings).
